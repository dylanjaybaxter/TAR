CPE 357 Asgn4

Special Instructions: None
Other Notes: Using perror to print to stdout. For some reason
when replacing perror(->fprintf(stderr, test 42 times out. I cannot fathom
why this addition effects anything let alone that one particular test,
but I have tested this and have determined that a single fprintf, even in the
first check of mytar.c is enough to trigger it.
